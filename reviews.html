                <p>We were not impressed and will not be returning.  The food had no seasoning at all and I think the mac & cheese came out of a box!  Plus the server was rude and stood around talking loudly on the phone, using curse words.  I will not be bringing my family (with small children) back to this establishment.</p>

                <p>(Sigh) I am truly disappointed with the experience I had with MJD.  I had a catered lunch from them a few months ago and loved it.  So when I needed to organize my own catered lunch for 15-20 people a co-worker and I chose to use them.  Big mistake...HUGE!<br>
                    I called them on Thursday afternoon to place our order for the Tuesday lunch.  I was told to call back on Sunday to place the order.  Strange but okay if that's what they want.  I called back on Sunday and ordered a half pan of: fried chicken, baked ham, mac 'n cheese, greens, corn casserole and a few pieces of catfish.Our order was over $350, including a $50 delivery charge for just this smallish order?!<br>
                    Even though we scheduled the delivery for 30 minutes before our meeting was supposed to start it arrived only 5 minutes ahead of time.  No plates, forks, knives or even napkins were included.<br>
                    We were all so excited to sit down and eat and then we discovered the greens and ham were completely cold.  We actually had to microwave our plates (which we thankfully found some in the breakroom).  The mac 'n cheese was soup but not cheesy, the casserole was dry (I didn't even know corn casserole could be dry) and the fish was salty.  On top of the fish being salty, it wasn't even catfish, it was whitings.  We PAID for CATFISH.<br>
                    Then someone noticed the barcode sticker mixed into the greens.  At that point I had enough and called to talk to a manager only to be told he was not available and I was hung up on.  I immediately called back and let them know that we were calling from a large firm and that they had the chance to earn or lose a lot of repeat customers because were going to spread the word and not return to this establishment, both as individuals and as a company who makes frequent catering orders.  All of a sudden the manager was available.<br>
                    After a 15 minute discussion with the manager he still refused to compensate us for these issues.  He tried to offer us discount coupons on future meals.  Thanks, but no thanks.  I will NEVER return to this establishment and I'm making everyone I know aware of these issues.  Dine at your own risk.</p>

                <p>Small family restaurant that makes great soul food.  The staff is wonderful.  I love their smothered pork chops with the mixed greens and macaroni and cheese, but everything we've had has been outstanding.  If I ever need a caterer for an event I will definitely be using them.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.</p>

                <p>How do you tell HTML from HTML5?<br>
                Try it out in Internet Explorer.<br>
                Did it work?<br>
                No?<br>
                It's HTML5!</p>
